## 🧭 About This Package

This package was originally built for personal use—to simplify repetitive setup tasks in CodeIgniter 4 projects. Instead of manually configuring each new project, I wanted a way to install everything with Composer and publish all necessary resources in one go. That’s how cirebonweb/core was born.

Over time, I realized this structure could benefit others too—especially those managing multiple CI4 projects with shared features like login pages, dashboards, and admin panels. So I decided to share it publicly, as a small thank-you to the CodeIgniter 4 community that helped me grow as a developer.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

- This is not a global framework. It’s a personal vendor structure tailored for maintainability across multiple projects.

- Some views are not published to the root project by default. These are core features (like login dashboards) meant to be maintained centrally and published selectively.

- The term “dashboard” here refers to ready-to-use pages with built-in features like login tracking, statistics, data tables, and reset actions—not just a layout shell.

## ⚠️ Notes for Users

- The structure may look unconventional, but it follows CI4 standards and works reliably.

- If you find the layout unfamiliar, remember: this started as a personal tool, not a global solution.

- Documentation may look polished, but I’m still learning—transitioning from WordPress to MVC frameworks has been a journey, and this package reflects that growth.

## 🙏 Final Thoughts

This project is a reflection of real-world pain points and the desire to build maintainable, scalable systems. If it helps you, I’m grateful. If you want to contribute or adapt it, even better.
